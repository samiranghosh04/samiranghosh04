## Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **BBC Article Scraper**: This is a simple web scraper built using Node.js, Express, Cheerio, and Axios. It fetches the latest articles from the [BBC's website](https://www.bbc.com/) and prints an array of objects called "articles" to the console. Each object contains the headline and the link to the article. (https://github.com/samiranghosh04/bbc-article-web-scraper)

2. **cryptopulse**: Free price tracker of over 120+ cryptocurrencies built with React, Axios and a free public/third party API. (https://github.com/samiranghosh04/cryptopulse)

Feel free to explore and provide feedback or suggestions. I'm always open to learning and improving my skills!

## Current Focus
